## Maths
If you are using `*` as a multiplication sign, 
please escape it (ie type `\*`) so there are no rendering issues on other platforms. 
If you want to use maths use the follwing syntax for inline expressions: 
`$2\times x$` producing: $2\times x$.
For display: `$$ \\{a,\\ b \\} $$`
$$  \\{a,\\ b \\}  $$
Note that you will need to use a double backslash for single letter TeX commands, 
as well as `/` (ie `\\`) and `\\` (ie `\\\\`).
