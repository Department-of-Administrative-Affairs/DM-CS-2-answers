# Contributing

By contributing you agree to licence your work under the current licence. 
The file you contribute must be in Github-Flavored Markdown, 
if you believe LaTeX support is neccessary, 
please file an issue.
If you are adding a information or similar file about a module, exam paper or anything else, 
call the file `README.md` in the folder because then Github will preview the file when opened.


## Maths
If you are using `*` as a multiplication sign, 
please escape it (ie type `\*`) so there are no rendering issues on other platforms.
If you wish to include some maths that GitHub doesn't support, use https://tex-image-link-generator.herokuapp.com/ to encode it into a form GH understands. (This site simply puts a image sourced from the GitHub maths renderer site with the url encoded properly). 
I recommend wrapping the block in `\color{#888}{ ... }` so it is visible in both light and dark mode.
